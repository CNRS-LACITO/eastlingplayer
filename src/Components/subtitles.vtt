00:00:04.583 --> 00:00:06.392 align:center
A few weeks ago,

00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:07.892 align:center
I sat down with my mother

00:00:07.916 --> 00:00:12.541 align:center
and told her something that I had been
keeping from her for 22 years.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.184 align:center
From the time that I was 14 years old

00:00:16.208 --> 00:00:18.642 align:center
until I was 16,

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.416 align:center
I was sexually assaulted.

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:24.916 align:center
It was scary and confusing.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.666 align:center
It was humiliating.

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:30.934 align:center
And even though I can genuinely say

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.809 align:center
that my mom and I have always
had a close relationship,

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:36.934 align:center
I never told her.

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.476 align:center
Even with recent movements
bringing the topics

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.559 align:center
of sexual abuse and sexual assault
into mainstream conversation,

00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:45.250 align:center
I stayed silent.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.083 align:center
And I guarantee that for every
brave soul who said "Me too,"

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.875 align:center
there were countless others who didn't ...

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.500 align:center
who still haven't.

00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:01.625 align:center
Why didn't those people speak up earlier?

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.916 align:center
Why didn't I?

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:07.541 align:center
Because of the shame.

00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:10.392 align:center
Because of that feeling inside

00:01:10.416 --> 00:01:16.226 align:center
telling me that what happened
to me was my fault.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.517 align:center
We all hear that voice sometimes.

00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:20.434 align:center
It tells us things like,

00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:22.101 align:center
you are aren't good enough,

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:23.666 align:center
you aren't smart enough ...

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:26.375 align:center
you can't give a TED talk.

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:28.892 align:center
We hear that voice,

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:31.291 align:center
and it becomes difficult
to hear anything else.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.934 align:center
We begin to agonize over
what other people will think of us --

00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.309 align:center
how they will judge us

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.416 align:center
if they found out our darkest secrets.

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:45.958 align:center
Shame is so powerful
that it can become part of who we are.

00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:48.226 align:center
I told my mom what happened to me

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.166 align:center
and one of the first things
that she said was,

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:55.059 align:center
"Oh, Kristin,

00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:59.208 align:center
I've been wondering what's been
driving you so hard all of these years."

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:02.708 align:center
She could see it before I could.

00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:05.559 align:center
My shame was so deep-rooted

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:10.101 align:center
that I had overcompensated
by trying to be perfect

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:12.583 align:center
in every other area of my life.

00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:16.601 align:center
Trying to build the perfect family,

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:17.916 align:center
the perfect career,

00:02:19.083 --> 00:02:25.000 align:center
by trying to exhibit control
instead of the chaos I felt inside.

00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:29.642 align:center
I have been trying my entire life

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:32.541 align:center
to orchestrate how the world perceives me,

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:36.625 align:center
because inside I haven't felt good enough.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.291 align:center
She always said that I burned
the candle at both ends,

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:44.041 align:center
and now she knew why.

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:47.392 align:center
Some people may be
more prone to shame than others,

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:50.267 align:center
but sexual abuse doesn't discriminate.

00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:51.726 align:center
It has the ability

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.601 align:center
to make even the most confident of us
think painful, negative thoughts.

00:02:57.625 --> 00:02:58.875 align:center
Why?

00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:02.726 align:center
Because it takes away control
over the one thing in this life

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.684 align:center
that is supposed to be
truly and entirely our own:

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:08.083 align:center
our bodies.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.958 align:center
I've been haunted by one thought
since my experience first began.

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:17.726 align:center
As I tried to make sense
of what happened to me,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.375 align:center
I thought to myself:

00:03:20.541 --> 00:03:22.291 align:center
this is all my fault.

00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:26.625 align:center
I didn't say "no" good enough.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.500 align:center
Next time, I'll say "no" better.

00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:35.559 align:center
I've questioned why
that was my go-to response

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:39.517 align:center
and why my shame was so deep and heavy

00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:44.083 align:center
that it paralyzed me
from speaking my truth for so long.

00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:48.642 align:center
And now that I'm the parent
of two amazing children,

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:51.351 align:center
I constantly wonder what I can do

00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:55.059 align:center
and what we can all do as a society

00:03:55.083 --> 00:03:57.226 align:center
to get ahead of the shame

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.059 align:center
and instead empower our children
to know without a doubt

00:04:01.083 --> 00:04:03.458 align:center
that sexual abuse isn't their fault.

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:05.476 align:center
Dr. BrenÃ© Brown,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.934 align:center
who has done incredible research
around shame and vulnerability,

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.976 align:center
calls shame the most powerful
master emotion.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.059 align:center
And I couldn't agree more.

00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:19.351 align:center
Shame has the power to make kids
who have been sexually assaulted

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:22.184 align:center
or in some other way victimized by adults

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:24.184 align:center
turn in on themselves

00:04:24.208 --> 00:04:27.392 align:center
and experience intense internal pain.

00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:28.958 align:center
But think about that.

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:33.916 align:center
Isn't that incredibly unfair?

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.434 align:center
Haven't we failed as a society

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:42.791 align:center
when the end result
is a child feeling shame?

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:47.642 align:center
Shouldn't it be the perpetrators?

00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:51.208 align:center
Shouldn't they be ashamed
of what they've done?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.684 align:center
Instead, they prey
on the shame of children

00:04:57.708 --> 00:05:01.458 align:center
and manipulate them into thinking
that what happened is their fault.

00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:06.101 align:center
The person who violated me fed my shame

00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:08.559 align:center
and I played right into it,

00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:12.267 align:center
becoming a knot of tortured silence

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:14.434 align:center
for many years.

00:05:14.458 --> 00:05:17.434 align:center
But is that shame also my fault?

00:05:17.458 --> 00:05:20.017 align:center
Not as a victim but as a parent,

00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:21.517 align:center
who like so many of us,

00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:25.059 align:center
has unthinkingly said things
to my children like,

00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:26.684 align:center
"Don't let anyone touch you;

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:28.559 align:center
don't let anyone hurt you;

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:32.208 align:center
don't put yourself in situations
where you can become a victim."

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:36.226 align:center
As parents, we believe
that we're empowering our children

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.101 align:center
to take ownership of their bodies,

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:41.017 align:center
but when we say
"don't let anyone touch you,"

00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:42.767 align:center
what we're really saying is

00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:46.291 align:center
"you are responsible
for the actions of somebody else."

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.309 align:center
We're treating this subject
like it's something children can control,

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:52.226 align:center
which is unrealistic,

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.351 align:center
and are in turn creating a sense
of false responsibility

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:57.166 align:center
in the mind of a child.

00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:01.642 align:center
An internal narrative
that tells them it is their job

00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:04.392 align:center
to stop bad things from happening,

00:06:04.416 --> 00:06:09.017 align:center
that they as children
are responsible for stopping the actions

00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:11.226 align:center
of someone who is usually bigger,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.517 align:center
stronger

00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:14.250 align:center
and older than they are.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:19.101 align:center
I heard a message that I should have
been able to stop what was happening to me

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:21.601 align:center
and that made me blame myself.

00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:27.184 align:center
I developed and then believed the idea
that I had done something wrong.

00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:31.976 align:center
I constantly wonder if I'm unintentionally
setting the same traps for my children.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.226 align:center
I'm not wrong for wanting
to keep my kids safe,

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.434 align:center
but I might be wrong for inadvertently
telling them the same sorts of things

00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:42.375 align:center
that I believed as a child --

00:06:43.291 --> 00:06:46.851 align:center
that I could prevent someone
from taking advantage of me

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:48.125 align:center
by saying "no,"

00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:50.434 align:center
and therefore,

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:52.226 align:center
if my "no" didn't work,

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.625 align:center
that it was my fault.

00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:56.851 align:center
As a survivor,

00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:00.791 align:center
I want to tell them now
what I longed to hear then:

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:04.101 align:center
that there is nothing you can do

00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:07.226 align:center
to prevent yourself
from being taken advantage of

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.101 align:center
by someone who should know better.

00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:11.517 align:center
But at the same time,

00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:13.601 align:center
I want them to believe they have the power

00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:15.875 align:center
to stop someone
from taking advantage of them.

00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:19.916 align:center
I want them to feel ownership
of their bodies.

00:07:20.833 --> 00:07:23.601 align:center
I want to tell my kids
that I can protect them,

00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:25.791 align:center
and I want to believe that.

00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:29.226 align:center
But buried beneath
all those good intentions

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.559 align:center
and motherly instincts

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:31.875 align:center
is that same shame.

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:37.333 align:center
If I tell my kids that there's something
they can do to prevent sexual assault,

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.416 align:center
doesn't that mean that there's something
that I could have done?

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.291 align:center
We teach our children to say "no".

00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:48.375 align:center
I said "no" every time.

00:07:50.125 --> 00:07:54.291 align:center
And I quickly learned
that "no" doesn't always work.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.017 align:center
That doesn't mean
that saying "no" is the wrong idea,

00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:01.708 align:center
just that it's not a solution.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.583 align:center
This is a scary concept to talk about,

00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:10.392 align:center
but it's a reality that we have to face

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:12.500 align:center
and be honest about with our children.

00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:15.767 align:center
The more that I said "no,"

00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:18.642 align:center
the more I prolonged the inevitable.

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:20.642 align:center
It got to the point where I felt

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.559 align:center
that if I just gave in
and got it over with,

00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:27.625 align:center
at least I would have some peace
until whenever the next time would be.

00:08:30.416 --> 00:08:32.333 align:center
That made me feel like a failure.

00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:39.184 align:center
I felt all sense of power
I had over the situation slip away,

00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:42.142 align:center
and any grand illusions
of fixing what had happened

00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:45.642 align:center
only compounded the guilt
and shame that I felt

00:08:45.666 --> 00:08:49.750 align:center
for not being strong enough
to stop my abuse.

00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:54.083 align:center
Now I felt guilty for being weak.

00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:57.875 align:center
I felt guilty for being scared.

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:02.375 align:center
I was supposed to be stronger.

00:09:04.583 --> 00:09:06.833 align:center
I was supposed to say "no" better.

00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:12.392 align:center
My "no" was supposed to be enough.

00:09:12.416 --> 00:09:16.559 align:center
Now instead, I try to tell my kids
that if something bad happens to them,

00:09:16.583 --> 00:09:19.601 align:center
it's not because they didn't prevent it

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:22.625 align:center
nor is it on their shoulders
alone to say "no."

00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:24.934 align:center
Although it feels like it,

00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.500 align:center
sexual assault doesn't occur in a vacuum.

00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:31.601 align:center
It is enabled every single day

00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:34.267 align:center
by how our society misrepresents

00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:37.892 align:center
and conditions us
to think about sexual violence:

00:09:37.916 --> 00:09:42.726 align:center
the gender norms and systemic
misogyny that are ever-present,

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.601 align:center
the victimization of victims

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:46.934 align:center
and so much more.

00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.684 align:center
It is not just an individual problem,

00:09:50.708 --> 00:09:53.059 align:center
especially when some studies show

00:09:53.083 --> 00:09:55.142 align:center
that as many as one in four girls

00:09:55.166 --> 00:09:58.601 align:center
and one in 13 boys experience sexual abuse

00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:01.059 align:center
at some point during childhood.

00:10:01.083 --> 00:10:05.642 align:center
And that means it's not just
on individuals to solve it.

00:10:05.666 --> 00:10:10.476 align:center
So of course while I try to teach my kids
about strength and resilience

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.892 align:center
and persevering, and overcoming obstacles,

00:10:13.916 --> 00:10:15.726 align:center
I make sure that they know

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.541 align:center
strength doesn't mean facing
challenges or dark feelings alone.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.309 align:center
In fact, there's strength in numbers

00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:25.851 align:center
and strength in asking for help.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:30.125 align:center
I was ashamed to speak up
for fear of appearing weak,

00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:32.351 align:center
but what I learned

00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:36.333 align:center
is talking about what happened
to me only made me stronger.

00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:39.708 align:center
It made my shame start to dissipate.

00:10:40.916 --> 00:10:44.142 align:center
I teach my kids about courage,

00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:45.767 align:center
and I want them to know

00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:50.226 align:center
that courageous,
strong people ask for help.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.767 align:center
I remember when I was little,

00:10:51.791 --> 00:10:54.434 align:center
my parents would walk me to the bus stop.

00:10:54.458 --> 00:10:56.101 align:center
They said it was to keep my safe,

00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:57.767 align:center
and I believed that.

00:10:57.791 --> 00:11:00.030 align:center
I remember always looking out
for that white van

00:11:00.054 --> 00:11:01.471 align:center
that I had been warned about.

00:11:02.708 --> 00:11:06.000 align:center
But like over 90 percent of children
who are sexually abused,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.916 align:center
I wasn't taken off a street corner
or abducted from a shopping mall.

00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:15.642 align:center
I was violated by someone I knew.

00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:19.142 align:center
My parents did everything
they could to protect me,

00:11:19.166 --> 00:11:20.559 align:center
but what none of us realized

00:11:20.583 --> 00:11:23.434 align:center
was the foundation of shame
that was building inside

00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:25.642 align:center
when we talked about "stranger danger"

00:11:25.666 --> 00:11:26.934 align:center
and saying "no"

00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.791 align:center
and not becoming a victim.

00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:32.625 align:center
Of course this wasn't intentional.

00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:36.333 align:center
They did what all of us want
to do as parents ...

00:11:37.333 --> 00:11:42.684 align:center
imagine that there's something we can do
to protect our children from bad things,

00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:45.059 align:center
but the fact is we can't.

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:48.517 align:center
And we can't solve the problem
of sexual assault

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:52.851 align:center
by shifting all of the blame
onto victims or potential victims

00:11:52.875 --> 00:11:54.291 align:center
or even our loved ones.

00:11:55.291 --> 00:12:00.101 align:center
The blame, 100 percent,
is with the perpetrators.

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:03.017 align:center
And pretending that it lies anywhere else

00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:08.017 align:center
not only allows those who commit assault
to escape full responsibility

00:12:08.041 --> 00:12:11.375 align:center
but also perpetuates shame for victims.

00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:15.291 align:center
And I for one am tired of being ashamed.

00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:18.267 align:center
I'll be honest with you.

00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:21.601 align:center
I wrote at least 10 different
conclusions to this talk,

00:12:21.625 --> 00:12:23.000 align:center
but none of them felt right.

00:12:23.916 --> 00:12:27.684 align:center
And I think that's because
there isn't a conclusion here.

00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:31.142 align:center
There's no way to wrap
this subject up in a box,

00:12:31.166 --> 00:12:32.809 align:center
tie it in a perfect bow,

00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:35.250 align:center
set it aside and call it done.

00:12:36.541 --> 00:12:39.226 align:center
This requires ongoing,

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.559 align:center
open

00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:43.726 align:center
and sometimes uncomfortable conversations.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.642 align:center
And as much as I want
to protect my children now,

00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:51.517 align:center
what I've come to realize is I can't
protect them from sexual violence

00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:54.916 align:center
any more than my parents
could have protected me.

00:12:55.833 --> 00:12:59.601 align:center
But what I can protect them from is shame.

00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:04.434 align:center
God forbid my children
go through what I went through.

00:13:04.458 --> 00:13:08.017 align:center
I, at the very least, want them to know

00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:10.559 align:center
that sexual assault is not,

00:13:10.583 --> 00:13:12.184 align:center
never was

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.916 align:center
and never will be their fault.

00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:17.416 align:center
Thank you.
